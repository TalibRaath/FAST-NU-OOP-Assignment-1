In C++ this keyword is actually a pointer who has the address of a object
that has been created in driver function. We use this keyword or pointer in
parameterized constructors to distiguish between class member variables and
formal para meters of a function. When we use this pointer the compiler
understand that we are talking about class member variables. e.g

class employee{
    string name;
    int height;
    char gender;
public:
    employee(string name, int height, char gender){
        this->name = name;
        this->height = height;
        this->gender = gender;
    }
};

If we don't use this keyword in above example than it does not make sense
to compiler that of which name, height, gender we are talking about is it
class members or formal parameters of constructor.
